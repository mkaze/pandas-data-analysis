# Data Analysis with pandas

This repository contains a set of data analysis projects which I have done to teach myself [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) as well as practice data analysis on real publicly available datasets. In each of the projects I have tried to document the process of data analysis using [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) which contain codes, plots, visualizations and brief interpretations of the results and interesting findings. 

## List of projects:

- MovieLens 1M dataset: [project notebook](./projects/movielens-1m/MovieLens-1M.ipynb) ([dataset page](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/))
